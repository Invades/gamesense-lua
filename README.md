# Lua scripts
Won't be buying another sub for a while since I'll be taking a break from CS:GO so I might as well release everything I've made in case some people find it useful.

~~Would upload more but I wiped my drive and lost all my scripts in the process ðŸ˜”~~
I ended up finding them on my old hard drive (had them backed up) but some I either don't want to give out (yet? idk) or have already been remade on the forums and are much better than what I did (crossfire killstreak remake)
